# IndiaKababRenoTesting
This GitHub project is dedicated to the automation testing of the India Kabab Reno website, which is a popular Indian restaurant located at 1091 S Virginia St, Reno, NV 89502. The project focuses on testing various functionalities of the website, including user login, registration, online ordering, and table booking.

Technologies Used:
Selenium: The automation framework is built using Selenium, a widely-used testing tool for web applications. It provides robust features for interacting with web elements, performing actions, and validating expected results.

Java: The project is implemented using the Java programming language, which offers a rich set of libraries and frameworks for building scalable and maintainable automation scripts.

Maven: Maven is utilized for build management, providing dependency management and project structuring capabilities. It simplifies the management and configuration of project dependencies.

Testing Framework and Design Pattern:
The project follows a data-driven framework with the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. This design pattern enhances test maintainability, reusability, and readability by separating page objects (representing web pages) from the test scripts. It provides a clear separation of concerns, making the tests more modular and easier to maintain.

Login Functionality Testing: The login process is tested to ensure that registered users can log in securely and access their accounts. Test cases cover valid and invalid login attempts, authentication, and session management.

Online Ordering Testing: The online ordering feature is thoroughly tested, simulating user interactions, selecting menu items, adding to the cart, and verifying successful order placement.

Table Booking Testing: The project includes testing the table booking functionality, validating the reservation process, available time slots, and confirmation messages.

Payment Functionality Testing: Extensive testing is conducted on the payment functionality, ensuring secure payment processing, verifying payment gateways, and handling different payment scenarios.

Conclusion:
The India Kabab Reno Automation Testing project on GitHub provides a comprehensive suite of automated tests for the India Kabab Reno website. The project utilizes Selenium with Java, following a data-driven framework with the Page Object Model design pattern. It covers various critical functionalities such as home page testing, registration form testing, login functionality testing, online ordering testing, table booking testing, and payment functionality testing.
